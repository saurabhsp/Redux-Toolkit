# React + Vite + ReduxToolkit
A redux toolkit where predictable state is managed in a container. we use redux but it take more time and syntax is also complex so we need a redux toolkit as named toolkit it provides a tools like thunk and etc. also the boiler plate is also reduces. so many benefits of uses redux in any js applications so i do that code practice and understand how it is working
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
